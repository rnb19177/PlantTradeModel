#Code here will be for the work from chapter's 2/3 of the thesis.

  o  "Network_Functions"
      Code includes a script that constructs the network 

#The code that conducts the social network analysis seen in chapter 3:

  o  "small_network_vis.R"
      Code that visualises the network/small realisation of the network


  o  "nursery_distribution_analysis.R" (with plotting code "plotting_nursery_distribution_analysis.R") 
      This code produces the analysis where we consider the 7 different scenarios of initial nursery distributions on the network  

  o  "Out_degree_mean_var_analysis/"out_deg_mean_dispersal.R" & "plotting_out_deg_mean_var_analysis.R" 
      Includes the scripts for conducting the sensitivity analysis seen in chapter 3 for changing the out-degree mean and variance parameters. 


  Need to include consignment size analysis code
